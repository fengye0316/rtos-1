July 25
    : night mare is finished...
    :
    : I am still here, though.
    : I added CommunicationData object at BB
    : I trimmed CommunicationData little bit
    :
    : I need to add this object at TT 
    : and make good and efficient stroage space at BB
    : to hold as many as possible and as fast as possible
    :
    : one thing I have think about is sensor packed information
    : 00, I thought this was null for sensor but actually 
    : this is A1 sensor the way that I packed.....
    : I need to check all of these
    : and checked the random routine, I checked d0 sensor was selected
    : which should not be happed by code

july 19
    : I should finish TrainTask
July 18
    : 
    : 11,212
    :
    : block serial Read is implemented
    : only one task can call Read.
    : I can do this for multiple tasks with blocked queue.
    : but, at this moment I will make only one task listen serial
    : data.
    :
    :
July 17
    : add distributor server for blackboard server
    : now I am doing some testing.
    : I need to make collector server for BB and TT
    : and distributor, collector Srv for CC and TT and BB
    :
    : I have to make blackboard specification
    :
    :
July 13
    : switch output is strainge b9-a2..
    : 255 value is still displayed
    : need to check switch work
    : seems that I stucked
    :
July 12
    : AM
    :
    : I am working at hasMoreCommandSet or .....
    : I have to check these..
    :

July 12
    : currently 9626 source code line
    :
    : 1. make behaviors based train controller
    :
    : 2. make BB, CC, and make communication buffer task in between
    :
    : 3. make 2 train tasks with behavior control with commnication
    :	 with BB and CC
    :
    : 4. on Saturday, make train show. and, 
    :
    : 5. keyboard, tty, and display things
    :
    :
July 10
    : I made trainTask, trainTaskMain.cc
    : which has many function to move train
    : I need to think about position estimation 
    : at train task level
    : I made GetSmallTime() at sysCall.c
    : which read 8254 directly to get the exact time
    : I need to use this with UpTime() 
    : .. need use distance file from mcole
    :
    : finished to communicate with dijkstra
    : now I need to make command set from shotest path segment
    :
July 8 Mid
    : I made cheesy little command set for train.c(train Task)
    : start from one point and stop at another point
    :
    : I dealt with GPF problem. 
    : It was not becase of shared memory
    : ans stat.c task or sensorSrv.c task
    : I was using too much stack and literally use more memory than I
    : had.
    : 
    : sensor.c(sensor data gethering and command output0
    : 	I change command delay from 2 ticks to 3 ticks
    : 	because, on pentium EOS machine, there was sensor and command
    :	output collision so It was stucked.
    :
    : sensorSched.c (which send every 2 ticks to send sensor command)
    :
    : train.c (train task) read command set and ask sensorSrv(sensor
    : 	server for sensor data and run every 2 ticks)
    : 
    : sensorSrv.c (sensor server) : getting sensor whenever
    : 	who wants sensor data it reply for it
    : 	and read sensor data from sensor.c using absRead() as
    :	shared memory read( with disable Interrupt, enterCS()
    :	exitCS() )
    :
July 6 PM
    : I changed all sending part to sensor.c
    : and single sensing mode
    : and using Delay(3) long delay for sending command
    : I will find the way.
    : ........

July 6 am
    : made sensor 50msec(1 tick)
    : but it turns sout that interpreteData() doesn't work well
    : and speed and switch command can't be read
    : at the interface unit
    : I need read interface unit
    :
July 5
    : check command routine(send serial command)
    : still meshed up inside
    : sensor command, control command eat up each other
    : I have to check this 
    : or combine??????
    :
    : Sensor input is 30Hz(30ms , 3ms for one byte and
    : it has 10 sensor bytes come in, so 3ms * 10 = 30ms)
    : Now our system works in 50msec
    : ????

June 21
    : after GDT setting, read bindfile or a.out lead system down...
    : I don't know yet, hopefully not because of class and c++
